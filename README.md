Colorful Calculator is a React implementation of a pocket calculator program by the same name that I coded up with Java Swing for AP Computer Science. At the time, I was trying to follow all my friends’ footsteps and start working on side projects, and I randomly chose React to be the first thing to learn. Not having any good ideas for side projects that would not be too complex, I decided that I would simply reimplement my old AP Computer Science final project in React and try my best to follow "best practices". It turns out it wasn’t that simple, and building out Colorful Calculator became a really profound learning experience for me.

Just a sliver of what I learned from this side project were: component-based web design, React component hierarchy, callback functions (really important!!), and React component lifecycles. Safe to say, this project served its purpose of getting me to learn React, kickstarting my side project portfolio.

A couple of months after finishing this project, when I was learning about compilers in a Programming Languages class, I realized that calculators and finite automata have a lot in common since both are state machines. For example, pressing ‘C’ or ‘CE’ on a calculator resets it to its starting state while pressing an operator key takes the calculator to a state where only numbers can be pressed next. The overlap between finite automata and calculators explains why some of the logic in Colorful Calculator is so confusing.

Overall, Colorful Calculator was a major milestone in my college career, as it marks the first side project that I ever built using a coding language and a framework that were both self-taught, which in this case was TypeScript and React.
